    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Rackspace Cloud Files™ is an affordable, redundant, scalable, and dynamic storage service offering. 
      The core storage system is designed to provide a safe, secure, automatically re-sizing 
      and network-accessible way to store data.
      You can store an unlimited quantity of files and each one can be as large as 5 gigabytes. 
      Users can store as much as
      they want and pay only for storage space they actually use.
    </para>
    <para>    
      Additionally, Cloud Files provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and distribute 
      content behind the industry-leading Akamai Content Distribution Network. Cloud Files users get access to this network automatically
      without having to worry about contracts, additional costs, or technical hurdles.
    </para>
    <para>
      Cloud Files allows users to store/retrieve files and CDN-enable content via a simple 
      ReST (Representational
      State Transfer) web service interface. 
      There are also language-specific APIs that utilize the ReST API but make it much
      easier for developers to integrate into their applications.

        <title>Simplicity</title>
        <para>
          Cloud Files is simple to use for developers and non-developers alike. 
          Users can get started in as little as five minutes.
          Users do not have to know how to code to use Cloud Files and CDN. 
          Users can, within minutes, sign up for Cloud
          Files, create a Container, upload a file and publish that Container’s content through 
          the CDN. 
          The Cloud Files GUI is easy to navigate and use. 
          The Rackspace browser-based control
          panel lets users easily upload files and distribute on a CDN without writing any code.
        </para>
        <para>
          All the content can be backed by a CDN without complex negotiations and details of updating content for optimizing
          delivery. 
          Given the complexity of the CDN, 
          users may have to make a series of choices such as number of servers
          to use, etc., before obtaining the service. 
          After making the choices, users must ensure that their usage bills are accurate. 
          All
          these issues are handled by Cloud Files. 
          CDNs have, in the past, been the prerogative of companies with more money
          but Cloud Files has changed that.
        </para>
        <para> Cloud Files is a user-friendly and developer-friendly service. Security mechanisms
        are simple to use. Third-party tools which further simplify use of the storage service are
        available. Developers can use an Application Programming Interface (API) with
        language-specific bindings to develop utilities or applications. The API is easy to use and
        is documented with examples to get started quickly. </para>

          Pricing for Cloud Files with CDN starts at 15 cents per gigabyte of storage 
          and 8 cents per gigabyte inbound and 18
          cents per gigabyte of bandwidth outbound to any edge location around the globe. 
          There are no per-requests fees for CDN.

        <title>Flexibility</title>
        <para>
          Cloud Files is a dynamically expanding storage system. 
          It is very flexible and is built on the pay-for-use principle. 
          Customers
          can use as much or little storage as necessary, while paying only for storage space used. 
          There is no limit on total space
          used and individual files can be as large as 5GB. 
          The GUI control panel allows users to check storage space used and
          bandwidth utilized. 
          There are no upfront fees or contracts and end users pay only for storage space used and outgoing
          bandwidth that they use.
        </para>
        <para>
          System administrators can use this for simple manual updates as well. 
          Users do not have to know how to code to use
          Cloud Files and CDN. 
          No API is required to share files. 
          Non-developers have a simple web-interface that can be
          used to quickly and easily upload data and enable CDN access. 
          Multiple third party tools make it even more flexible for users of 
          specific environments such as the Mac OS.

        <para>
          Developers can use the ReST web service and language-specific APIs in 
          PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, and C#/.NET. 
          The APIs provide full support for managing content in Cloud Files and 
          publishing content over the CDN. 
          The API allows
          developers to work in the language they feel most comfortable using.

        <title>Data Redundancy</title>
        <para>
          The Cloud Files storage system is designed to be highly available and fault tolerant. 
          Cloud Files achieves client data
          redundancy by replicating three full copies on different storage nodes. 
          Storage nodes are grouped in logical Zones
          within Rackspace datacenters. 
          Zones are connected to redundant Internet backbone providers and reside on redundant
          power supplies and generators. 
          The system has been engineered in such a way as to continue to be fully functional
          even in the event of a major service disruption within a Datacenter. 
          Content on the CDN provides an additional layer
          of data redundancy.

      </section>
      <section xml:id="Security-d1e267">
        <title>Security</title>
        <para>
          Cloud Files uses a number of different measures to ensure that your data is kept safe. 
          First and foremost, all traffic
          between clients and the Cloud Files system uses SSL to establish a secure, 
          encrypted communication channel. 
          This ensures that any data (usernames, passwords, and content) 
          cannot be intercepted and read by a third-party. 
          Users authenticate with a valid username and API Access Key and are granted 
          a session authentication token. 
          These authentication
          tokens are used to validate all operations against Cloud Files. 
          There is no way to terminate a valid session by the user, 
          but the session tokens will automatically expire after 24 hours, 
          forcing clients to resend their credentials.
        </para>
        <para>
          The API Access Key is only available after login to the customer's Rackspace Cloud
          control panel. 
          Users must enter their valid username and password to gain access to view the
          API Access Key or to generate a new key.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is important to note that Cloud Files does not apply any transformations 
          to data before storing it. 
          This means that
          Cloud Files will not store data in encrypted form unless the client encrypts it 
          prior to transmission. 
          This allows users
          to select the type and level of encryption best suited to their applications.
        </para>
        <para>
          When deleting storage Objects from the Cloud Files system, 
          all copies of data are permanently removed within a
          matter of minutes. 
          Furthermore, the physical blocks making up the customer’s data are zeroed over 
          before that space is
          re-used for other customer data. 
          In other words, after a delete request, the data will be unrecoverable.

        Developers are also encouraged to join some of the members of the Cloud Files team at 
        irc.freenode.net on
        the #cloudfiles channel. 
        This is not an official Cloud Files support channel but should rather be viewed as a community
        meeting place to share ideas and discuss Cloud Files.
